        <h1>A Tribute to Massive Attack</h1>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Massive Attack is a British group formed in 1988 in Bristol, consisting of Robert "3D" Del Naja, Grant "Daddy G" Marshall and formerly Andy "Mushroom" Vowles ("Mush"). </p>
        <p>From their inception, Massive Attack quickly became pioneers of the trip-hop genre (though the bandmates have said in numerous interviews that they hate the term 'trip-hop'). People called Massive Attack's music 'trip-hop' because their musical style is very atmospheric, making a lot of use of bass and distorted instrumentals, which makes the listener feel like they are taking a trip through bass-infused electronic instrumentals reminiscent of hip-hop's. Massive Attack is also known for their sophiscated, world-weary lyrics - another parallel with hip-hop.</p>

    <h4>Lyrics for <cite>Pray for Rain</cite>:</h4>
    <p>In deepest hollow of our minds
    <br />
    A system failure left behind
    <br />
    And their necks crane
    <br />
    As they turn to pray for rain
    <br />
    And their necks crane</p>

    <p>Dull residue of what once was
    <br />
    A shattered cloud of swirling doves
    <br />
    And their eyes change
    <br />
    As they learn to see through flames
    <br />
    And their necks crane
    <br />
    As they turn to pray for rain
    <br />
    And their eyes change
    <br />
    As they learn to see through flames
    <br />
    And their necks crane
    <br />
    As they turn to pray for rain</p>


    <p>Drops on rocks fall fast and fleeting
    <br />
    Hearts and wings commence to beating
    <br />
    Woods unseen with all believing
    <br />
    Vision walls fall all receding
    <br />
    Vision walls fall all receding</p>


    <p>Drops on rocks come fast and fleeting
    <br />
    Rhythm laws unleash their meaning
    <br />
    Usher us into the dreaming
    <br />
    Vision walls fall all receding
    <br />
    Hearts and wings commence to beating
    <br />
    All unending all completing
    <br />
    Vision walls fall fast and fleeting
    <br />
    Vision walls fall all revealing
    <br />
    Vision walls fall all revealing
    <br />
    Vision walls fall all revealing
    <br />
    Vision walls fall all revealing</p>


    <p>In deepest hollow of our minds
    <br />
    A system failure left behind
    <br />
    Dull residue of what once was
    <br />
    A shattered cloud of swirling doves
    <br />
    And their eyes changed
    <br />
    As they learned to see through flames
    <br />
    And their necks craned
    <br />
    As they prayed for rain</p>
