# HTML_Hotness
A fanpage for '90's bands... with a twist.  

**CONCEPT**

This website will show the progression of web dev from the 1990s to today. The content will be a tribute/fan page for a 1990s band, and the user will be able to toggle between pure HTML (1990s) / CSS included (2000s) / JavaScript included (2010s). 

**SITE AESTHETICS / DESIGN**

There are three different appearances: Pure HTML, CSS included, and JavaScript included. They all have the same exact content but are different in appearance. 

When the user navigates to this webpage, a home page will greet the user and explain the project. There will be a menu that navigates to bands.

The user can interact with a 3-slot sliding tab with 3 positions: pure HTML (1990s), CSS (2000s), JavaScript (2010s). 


**ARTISTS THAT WILL BE INCLUDED**

Criteria: The artists must have been active since the 1990s and they must still be operating today. This will help tie in with the theme that the Internet has evolved and changed since the 1990s -- so have these bands. 

YES: 
* Massive Attack 
* Bjork 
* Missy Elliott

NO: 
* Nirvana and other bands that no longer operate today
* Sorry, no one-hit wonders. 

MAYBE: 
* Artists who were in bands in the 1990s but are now performing solo. Examples include Justin Timberlake and Beyonce.
